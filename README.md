# Face Detection Techniques using OpenCV and Deep Learning 
 
	>Different Face Detection Library and Methods such as :
		TENSORFLOW, ,CVLib,
		HAARCASCADE, DNN, CNN, HOG
		Dlib, FACE_RECOGNITION


Following Library has to be installed in order to run the code swiftly:

Opencv-contrib-python, matplotlib ,dlib, face-recognition, cvlib, requests, progressbar, keras, tensorflow

Make sure that the version numbers of your installed packages are equal to, or greater than, versions specified below to ensure the code examples run correctly. If you want to install the exact versions this book was tested on, include the version when installing from pip.

* Install opencv-contrib-python:

```
pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.0.0.21
```
It should be noted that OpenCV requires: ``numpy`` 

``numpy-1.16.1`` has been installed when installing ``opencv-contrib-python==4.0.0.21`` 

 * Install matplotlib:
 
```
pip install matplotlib==3.0.2
```
It should be noted that matplotlib requires: ``kiwisolver pyparsing six cycler python-dateutil``

``cycler-0.10.0 kiwisolver-1.0.1  pyparsing-2.3.1 python-dateutil-2.8.0 six-1.12.0`` have been installed when installing ``matplotlib==3.0.2``

 * Install dlib:
```
pip install dlib==19.8.1 
```

 * Install face-recognition:
```
pip install face-recognition==1.2.3
```
It should be noted that face-recognition requires: ``dlib Click numpy face-recognition-models pillow``

``dlib-19.8.1 Click-7.0 face-recognition-models-0.3.0 pillow-5.4.1`` have been installed when installing ``face-recognition==1.2.3``

 * Install cvlib:
```
pip install cvlib==0.1.8
```

 * Install requests:
```
pip install requests==2.21.0
```

It should be noted that requests requires: ``urllib3 chardet certifi idna``

``urllib3-1.24.1 chardet-3.0.4 certifi-2018.11.29 idna-2.8`` have been installed when installing ``requests==2.21.0``

 * Install progressbar:
```
pip install progressbar==2.5 
```

 * Install keras:
 
```
pip install keras==2.2.4
``` 
It should be noted that keras requires: ``numpy six h5py keras-applications scipy keras-preprocessing pyyaml``

``h5py-2.9.0 keras-applications-1.0.7 keras-preprocessing-1.0.9 numpy-1.16.1 pyyaml-3.13 scipy-1.2.1 six-1.12.0`` have been installed when installing ``keras==2.2.4``

 * Install tensorflow:
 
```
pip install tensorflow==1.12.0 
```
It should be noted that tensorflow requires: ``termcolor numpy wheel gast six setuptools protobuf markdown grpcio werkzeug tensorboard absl-py h5py keras-applications keras-preprocessing, astor``

``termcolor-1.1.0 numpy-1.16.1 wheel-0.33.1 gast-0.2.2 six-1.12.0 setuptools-40.8.0 protobuf-3.6.1 markdown-3.0.1 grpcio-1.18.0 werkzeug-0.14.1 tensorboard-1.12.2 absl-py-0.7.0 h5py-2.9.0 keras-applications-1.0.7 keras-preprocessing-1.0.9 astor-0.7.1`` have been installed when installing ``tensorflow==1.12.0``
